# Environmental-transportation-optimization


### Project outcome
Design a system for the logistic company to analyze the emissions of logistics vehicles.
Provide an optimized path for logistics vehicles.
Satisfy the majority of the logistics companyâ€™s employees. 


### Methodology

Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

- Analysis map:
	Cross road as node
	Street as edge 
	Distance as weight

By keep finding the shortest path between pair of node, by adding them together to get the shortest path between start and end node.
